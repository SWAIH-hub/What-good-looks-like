# Documentation and Reproducibility

##### RAPs

Reproducible analytics pipelines ([RAPs](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/what_is_RAP/)) are increasingly being utilised within the NHS. It provides a 
basic set of principles to follow that can be used to create faster, more robust and more transparent
data pipelines. A simple checklist can be used to assess how well the RAP principles are being adhered to:

- [ ] Is all code under version control? (e.g., storing code on cloud services such as GitHub and GitLab).
- [ ] Has any code been written in a modular way, following best practices, such that functions could be used again?
- [ ] Is all the code documented?
- [ ] Is as much code as possible been set as open-source?
- [ ] Are there unit tests that are being automatically performed when any of the code in the main repository is changed?
- [ ] Are any additions to the code going through a pull request and formal review process?
- [ ] If a process can be automated, is it being automated?

By following these principles, better, more transparent decisions can be made by leveraging the data
as wel as reducing any possible human error. By utilising and contributing to the open-source community,
any organisation fosters an ethos of collaboration that will not only allow other organisations to benefit
but could allow contributions and improvements to an organisation's code from external source.
