# Introduction to Data

Data analysis broadly covers four fundamental topics, each with a specific aim, which depends on the project scope. These areas are briefly outlined below:

##### Descriptive analytics

Descriptive analysis aims to answer the question ***"What has happened in the past?"***. This type of analysis is important when creating benchmarks for future performance. For example, by analysing historical waiting times at A&E, we can set benchmarks for future improvements. A successful descriptive analytics project should include a wide range of data sources related to the problem (while maintain data quality and completeness), offer clear and intuitive visualisations, and ensure regular (ideally automated) reporting.

##### Diagnostic

Diagnostic analysis aims to answer the question ***"why did this happen?"***. For example, it can help identify the causes of unexplained A&E waiting times or understand the factors driving hospital admissions. Various data science tools can be used for this purpose, such as regression analysis (including GLM modelling), correlation, and time series analysis. A good data science project will use a range of techniques tailored to the specific problem while distinguishing between correlation and causation to understand the core drivers of impact.

##### Predictive

Predictive analysis aims to answer the question ***"What is likely to happen in the future?"***. This type of analysis uses historical data to make forecasts or predictions for future events. For example, predictive analysis can be used to forecast future A&E admissions or predict the likelihood of hospital admissions based on historical data. Techniques include ML algorithms, time series forecasting, and regression models. A good predictive analytics project will utilise high-quality historical data, apply appropriate predictive models, and continuously validate and refine models to improve accuracy.

##### Prescriptive

Prescriptive analysis aims to answer the question ***"What should we do about it?"***. This type of analysis goes a step further by not only predicting future outcomes but also recommending actions to achieve organisational aims. For examples, prescriptive analysis may include simulation modelling, allowing a series of "what if?" scenarios to be simulated to optimise a measures outcome, such as patient waiting times, based on staffing levels. A successful project will provide clear and actionable recommendations, and align with organisational goals.
