# Technology 

Standardising technology within the NHS presents a transformative opportunity to streamline processes, improve data access, and foster collaboration between trusts. The aim is to create a unified ecosystem that promotes efficiency, ensures consistency and supports healthcare professionals in delivering high-quality care.

## Infrastructure

Establishing a robust and scalable infrastructure is the foundation for standardising technology across NHS trusts.

- **Shared Frameworks**: Adopting common frameworks and guidelines ensures compatibility and smooth integration across different systems.
- **Cloud-Based Solutions**: Transitioning to cloud storage and computing offers scalable, secure and cost-efficient solutions while enabling cross-trust collaboration.
- **Interoperability**: Standardising APIs and adopting common protocols will facilitate seamless data exchange between trusts, third-party vendors and national bodies.

## Data Warehousing

A centralised data warehouse ensures that trusts can store and access data consistently, enhancing collaboration and analytics capabilities.

### Storage

- **Scalable Solutions**: Standardising storage solutions will ensure adequate capacity to handle increasing volumes of healthcare data.
- **Data Archiving Policies**: Implementing consistent retention policies ensures compliance with GDPR and supports efficient long-term storage management.

### Availability of Data

- **Single Point of Access and Request**: Creating a unified request policy allows healthcare professionals to access relevant datasets securely, improving efficiency while reducing duplication.
- **Standard Request Forms**: Introducing uniform forms for data requests ensures consistency and reduces processing errors across trusts.
- **Standard Return Criteria**: Clearly defined criteria for the output format and level of detail ensures that data returned from one trust is readily interpretable by another.

## Data Sources and Linkage

Combining and linking data from multiple sources (e.g., electronic health records, lab results, imaging data) is critical for enabling comprehensive patient insights. At present this could be difficult due to the differences in Patient Administration Systems.

### Centralisation of Data

- A centralised data repository for all trusts would provide a "single source of truth" and improve consistency in research and decision-making.
- Access to a centralised platform could support national initiatives, such as population health management or research into rare diseases etc.

### Standard Keys

- Implementing shared identifiers (e.g., NHS numbers) for linking patient data across trusts ensures data accuracy and interoperability.
- Standard keys also improve analytics and reporting consistency.

## Cybersecurity

The centralisation of data and reliance on technology require robust security measures.

### Training and Awareness

- Regular staff training on cybersecurity best practices ensures all NHS employees can identify and mitigate risks such as phishing and ransomware attacks.
- Continuous education about emerging threats and data protection laws (e.g., GDPR) supports compliance and safeguards sensitive patient information.

## Data Quality

Ensuring high data quality is fundamental for making accurate clinical decisions and supporting robust analytics (which may include national submissions such as CDS).

### Error Handling

- Standardising error-checking mechanisms, such as automated validation scripts, will reduce inconsistencies across trusts.
- Implementing robust logging and monitoring systems ensures that data errors are promptly identified and resolved, this could be small python scripts or a suite of Test-Driven Development (TDD) tests.

### Importance

- Accurate data underpins effective patient care, research and resource allocation. Inconsistent data impacts decision-making and erodes trust in analytics systems.

### Automation Using AI

- Incorporating AI for tasks like identifying outliers, filling missing values, or classifying unstructured data (e.g., free-text notes) can improve data quality and could potentially reduce manual effort.

---

## Automation

Automating routine processes can reduce administrative burdens and allow healthcare staff to focus on patient care.

### Routine Processes

- Automating appointment scheduling, a few examples: Test result notifications or prescription reminders can save significant time across trusts.
- Shared templates and workflows for automation across trusts ensure scalability and efficiency.

---

## Tools Used

Standardising the tools and technologies employed across trusts will promote consistency and reduce duplication of effort.

### Choosing Languages

- **SQL**: As a universal language for managing and querying data in healthcare, SQL should be the standard for data warehousing.
- **Python / R**: Both languages are highly effective for advanced analytics, machine learning and statistical modelling. Establishing guidelines for their use can ensure consistent coding standards.
- **DAX**: If trusts are using Visualisation tools such as BI, there could be a centralised library of DAX for the replicating of visuals based off of shared datasets.

### Dashboarding Software

- Standardising dashboarding tools, such as Power BI, Tableau, or open-source options can improve the consistency of visual reporting. Shared templates for clinical dashboards ensure that key metrics, such as hospital admissions or ED wait times are easily understood across trusts.

## Conclusion

Developing a shared resource for best practices in technology will transform NHS operations allowing trusts to work together more effectively. By standardising infrastructure, tools and processes, the NHS can foster innovation, improve patient outcomes and create a sustainable framework for the future of healthcare.
