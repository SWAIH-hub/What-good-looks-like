# Organisational Structure

##### Shared Services

* The implementation of standardised approaches that would be facilitated by a shared service would ensure consistency in data processing and reporting across organisations, improve data quality and introduce a single style of reporting, making it easier to compare outcomes or performance across the system. A shared service approach would build on best practice, rolling out system-wide solutions quickly and consistently so all organisations benefit from innovations.
*	Sharing of resources between organisations, providing resilience and cross-cover especially for roles where skills and capacity are scarce.
*	By sharing resource you are also sharing skills, with pooling of expertise promoting better learning, sharing of best practice and spread of innovation. 
*	A shared service can achieve significant economies of scale and efficiencies, reducing duplication of effort, quickly spreading best practice and utilising scale to achieve more competitive procurement of software and services
*	A shared service would require single leadership, creating a clear, unified vision for the development of the service. A single leadership approach would be able to set direction, drive improvement, balance resources and resolve competing priorities
