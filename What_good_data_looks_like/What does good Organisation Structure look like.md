What does good Organisation Structure look like from “data” perspective?

Understand the challenge:

Many organisations have data professionals spread across different teams with different specialities, knowledge, and experience. Those teams will likely use different systems, tools, go through different standard of training. Those data professionals may not be aware of other colleagues in the organisation and may face challenges on their own, without knowing that the support is just behind the corner. 

Every organisation like to think they base their decisions on data, but not many are utilising their data to its full potential. This may be because of the problems mentioned above as well as lack of Data professionals voice at the trust board. Organisations usually will have Digital or Digital and data representatives but the “data” bit when standing next to digital is usually about security of the data in the electronic system, confidentiality, transferability rather than “what can the data tell us?”

Common trend for data professionals is sharing the good practice and not reinventing wheel, but how many organizations have established network in place with their neighbours, this being other NHS or other healthcare providers?

Famous data saying goes like this ”Garbage in, garbage out”, and in fact no one can hide from data quality problems.  

What does good look like?

Getting your structure right to what works well for the size of your organisation will vary but what Data team structures should do is to maximize efficiency for the services provided, decision making etc. Ensure to have Data lead representative with a voice in Trust board, lead who shapes data strategy for your organisation. Lead responsible for your policies and procedures related to Data including AI policy? Lead looking after funding for teams, development, system & tool.

Is Centralised structure the answer we are looking for? Yes, however you might say there are pros and cons for this, but it is better fit if you want to tackle the system wide problems and create one team approach.

Get to know your neighbours. Establish regional networks. Find out if there is region wide project going on that could benefit your organization. Share learnings, good practice but also don’t be afraid to seek help.
